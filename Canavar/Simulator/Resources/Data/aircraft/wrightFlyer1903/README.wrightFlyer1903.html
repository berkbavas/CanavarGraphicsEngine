Model description and updates:

12/21/02 - Updates to aircraft aero file, and tweaks (above and below)
           in this file.

5/26/02 - First release: v1-nl

* This model is based partly on wind tunnel tests of a 1903 Wright
  Flyer replica tested at NASA Ames by a group lead by Prof Culick at
  Caltech.  The model is a nonlinear model, meaning that stall of both
  the canard and biplane wing is included.  Because the replica was
  not tested to stall, data in this regime had to be deduced from a
  number of different sources, including low Reynolds number airfoil
  data taken at UIUC.

* Wonder what it was like to fly the 1903 Wright Flyer?  Be a test
  pilot.  See the longitudinal static instability.  Fly steady,
  straight and level, then put in a brief canard pulse (elevator
  stick) so as not to change the trim speed.  With an up canard pulse
  and hands off the stick, the Wright Flyer will start to pitch
  upwards until it stalls.  Down pulse, and it goes down.  This same
  instability is seen by simply trying to fly straight and level!  The
  rates are low enough that a good pilot with practice can stay ahead
  of the static instability.  Stall can get pretty nasty if both the
  canard and biplane wing stall at the same time. Typically, however,
  the canard will stall first.  Full up elevator can be used to fly
  out of the dive.  But in this condition the canard is
  stalled.  Relieving the back pressure will move the canard out of
  stall and the pull-out will be a little bit faster, but the
  difference is hard to notice.  Keep in mind that this aircraft was
  flown four times before it was damaged on Dec 17, 1903.  The first
  flight was 120 feet in 12 seconds, and the last was 852 feet in 59
  seconds.  How far can you fly?

* Run with the FGFS "enable-auto-coordination" option (default setup
  includes this option) to model the coupling between the wing warping
  and rudder to counteract the adverse yaw effect of the wing warping.
  The amount of coupling has been set to match that on the original
  Wright Flyer (see the aircraft.dat file for some specs).  The
  resulting handling is "not that great."  For later designs, the
  Wright Brothers decoupled the warping and rudder to have more
  control and the ability to fly in coordinated flight with
  cross-controls.

* Finally, it's a hand full!
